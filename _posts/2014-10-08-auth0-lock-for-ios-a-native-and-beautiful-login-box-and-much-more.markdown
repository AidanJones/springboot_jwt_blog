> TL:DR; Try out our new iOS SDK. Learn how to [use it with Swift](https://docs.auth0.com/native-platforms/ios-swift) or [with Objective C](https://docs.auth0.com/native-platforms/ios-objc)!

------------------------------------------------------


Smartphones are here to stay. Lots of **our customers are using a Mobile First** methodology by creating iOS and Android app even before WebApps.

Most of this **apps need to have a user Login & Signup**. However, adding this in an iOS apps **isn’t that easy and takes a lot of time**.

That’s why we decided to build **[Auth0 Lock for iOS](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.ios)**. We’ve put a lot of effort in making it really simple to use but yet very powerful.

<!-- more -->

The main features it provides are:

* A **beautiful native UI** to log your users in
* Support for **Social Providers** (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), **Enterprise Providers** (AD, LDAP, etc.) and **Username & Password**
* The ability to do **SSO with 2 or more mobile apps** similar to Facebook and Messenger apps.
* Works with both **Swift and Objective C**

Using it is really easy and straight forward. You can read our [Swift Tutorial](https://docs.auth0.com/native-platforms/ios-swift) and [Objective C](https://docs.auth0.com/native-platforms/ios-objc) tutorial to know how to get it running in your app in less than an hour, and you can also check out the [Swift Sample](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.iOS/tree/master/Examples/basic-sample-swift) as well as the [Objective C sample](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.iOS/tree/master/Examples/basic-sample).

You can read about its API on the [Github README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.iOS/blob/master/README.md) as well as in [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=Auth0.ios)
