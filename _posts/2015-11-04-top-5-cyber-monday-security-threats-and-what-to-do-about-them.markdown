With **Cyber Monday** just around the corner, there are lots of people that still wonder if it is safe to buy online in these end-of-year sales events. Of course it is safe in the sense that you won't be pushed, hit, or crushed by other customers that also want to get hands on the big deals. But we specifically refer to what things you have to take into account to enjoy the big discounts and not worry about getting ourselves in trouble.

Historically, November and December are the months with most online transactions, and therefore the months where cyber-criminals are most active.

We will enumerate the top 5 security threats when online shopping and give you hints on how be safe on these dates.

## Phishing

**--INSERT IMAGE HERE--**

The most dangerous threat of this season is **Phishing**. Phishing is when cyber criminals attempt to get your usernames, passwords, and credit card details by creating a fake version of a real and well-known site. Users get tricked into entering their sensitive information thinking that the site is the real one. You can get in one of these sites by misspelling the site address, or by following links on forged emails, ads, or posts.

The [Anti-Phishing Working Group](http://www.antiphishing.org/) reports that on the last quarter of 2014 there was an increase of 18 percent in the number of unique phishing reports compared to the previous quarter, and that **Retail/Service** was the most-targeted industry sector in the fourth quarter of 2014, with **Payment Services** close behind.

Here are some tips to make sure yo don't get into a phishing site:

- Double check the URL of the page you are on, make sure it has no typos before entering sensitive data. Forged sites may look exactly the same as the original ones.
- Look for the padlock. Whenever you are going to enter your information, be it username, passwords, or your credit card data verify that the site has a secure connection. You will also notice that the URL will start with **https** instead of **http**.

Additionally, you can get Phishing filters as an additional measure to be protected against this threat. Modern browsers, such as  *Chrome*, *Opera*, *Internet Explorer*, *Microsoft Edge*, or *Safari* offer built-in Anti Phishing features. Furthermore, you can get specific anti-phishing software from the top antivirus and security companies, such as **Avast**, **Avira**, **ESET**, **Kapersky**, and others.

## Malware & Social Networks scams

**--INSERT IMAGE HERE--**

Malware as well as social networks scams are a latent threat, which is expected to increase during this season. 
Don't trust unbelievable deals if they come from unreliable sources, such an email or trough social media, as they are probably not true. Fake deals will redirect you to phishing sites or trick you to download malware.
With the uprise of Social Media, attackers are focusing on its users. Social Media provide attackers a high propagation rate, as affected users will share posts and links to all their friends/followers without even knowing.

Here are some hints to avoid malware and scams.

- If you see a suspicious post from a friend, don't open the link. Tell him to ensure if he was the one that published the post and to take action immediately.
- Stay up-to-date with your Operating System versions, as security holes are patched as soon as they are detected.
- If you are using the application of a retail store, make sure you have the latest version, be it a mobile or desktop app. Same as with Operating Systems, application updates may fix detected security holes and improve stability.
- Install antivirus & malware protection software.

## Using Public terminals and Networks

**--INSERT IMAGE HERE--**

Never, ever enter your credit card number on a public Wifi or terminal. Really, we cannot stress enough how this is a bad idea. Anyone can be in public networks, including attackers listening the network traffic, and these public networks offer no security. It doesn't matter if the site you are trying to access is secure, as the way to get there is not. Private networks, or even the 3G/4G mobile networks are safer.

## Having a weak Password

**--INSERT IMAGE HERE--**

Big sites typically have strong security measures, but security is as strong as its weakest link. Don't let your password be your weakest link. Especially, if it is for a site that contains sensitive information, such as your credit card information.
Nowadays, several sites enforce the usage of secure passwords but for those that don't you should be proactive.

Here are some tips to create a secure password:

- Don't use information related to yourself that can be obtained easily, such as ID numbers, your nickname, your pet name, and so on.
- Use lower and uppercase, numbers and symbols in your password. An easy way to get a secure password is to get a phrase you know, or better some random words; and replace some characters with numbers and symbols. For example: "I love donuts" can be converted to: **Il0v3D0nuts**, which is quite a strong password.

Some sites have features to alert you (through email or text) when suspicious activity in your account occurs, such as failed login attempts, logins from a different country or at unusual hours. If you have the choice, always enable this option.

## Shopping in Unsecure Sites

**--INSERT IMAGE HERE--**

Maybe you want to buy something from a small site, or a new site. Maybe that little-known site is the only that has that precious item you want. Well you can do it if you trust the company, but most of all if you check that the site meets the following security measures.

- Ensure the site protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. You can verify this, by checking that the URL of the website starts with *https*, and that the browser shows the **padlock icon** to indicate the use SSL certificates.
- Read the privacy & security information of the site to know how they handle privacy and security. From this you can also learn if the site takes security seriously, for example if they implement Brute Force Protection, IP logging, among other measures.
- Some sites outsource the payment platform to online payment services such as **[Paypal](http://www.paypal.com)**, in this way these well-known services handle all the users data and typically they have strong security measures in place. 
- Share only the necessary information to make your purchase. For example, if a site asks you for your social security number, employer, relatives information, and such; do not trust that site.
- If you login using a social provider, always verify the information that the site asks. Most times, you will find that sites ask for information that they do not need, such as your friend list.

## Final words

Finally, we will like to give you a word of advice to complement these things. **Use a low-limit credit card to buy online**; in case it gets compromised, attackers won't do much damage. And more important, **check your credit card statement periodically**, if you detect unknown or suspicious charges you will be able to contact your bank and reject the transactions.

Keep these things in mind, and we promise you will be buying from the comfort of your couch, getting Cyber Monday deals safely.


Happy Shopping!
