**tl;dr**: I've created a [pluralsight course](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/authenticating-angular-spa-aspnet-webapi-auth0) on how to implement Auth0 in an AngularJS application going against an ASP.NET WebAPI backend.

# Table of contents

The course is split into the following three modules:

* **An Introduction**: Course introduction with brief overview of Auth0, where we also register for a free developer account.
* **Building the Back-end API**: In this module we create the back-end and secure it with Auth0, we also test our API by making secure calls with postman.
* **Building the Front-end SPA**: In this module we create the front-end using AngularJS to communicate securely with our back-end. We use Auth0Lock to get a professional looking login dialog that displays well on any resolution and device.

# Why do a course on Auth0?

First of all, I'm new to using Auth0 as a service, I stumbled upon it when trying to find a quick to implement solution for a client I was working with a couple of months ago. I was amazed by how fast we were up and running and could move on to writing the business logic.

Aside from consulting I also teach and speak at conferences and to strengthen my brand I decided to try out for becoming a pluralsight author. The [audition](https://youtu.be/QjAfgfTZfho) went well, but angular 2 was off the table since it's still in alpha. When browsing the pluralsight library I noticed there was nothing on Auth0 there, so why not be the first one to contribute with an Auth0 course?  

# Working with the Pluralsight team

From the initial contact with the audition to working close with my editor on the course, pluralsight was super professional. I really enjoyed the experience, and I definitely encourage other developers to go through the experience of creating a course. Even if I have some experience from creating [screencasts on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AjdenTowfeek) this was something entirely different.

# Conclusion

After 30 hours of recording and editing the course was finished and it's now live, make sure to [check it out](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/authenticating-angular-spa-aspnet-webapi-auth0). Auth0 is an awesome service and I'll definitely recommend it to future clients.
