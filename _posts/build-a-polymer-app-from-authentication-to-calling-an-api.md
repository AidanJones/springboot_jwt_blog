**TL;DR** [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) provides tools and polyfills for building elements and applications with web components. We'll build a web app using Polymer and its CLI, call an external API, and add authentication with [JSON Web Tokens](http://jwt.io). The full code is available at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/auth0-blog/polymer-with-jwt-api).

## What Are Web Components?

Many frameworks use the term "components" (ie., [Angular 2](http://learnangular2.com/components/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)). In general, _components_ are commonly understood to be modular pieces of code that provide UI and/or scripting in a reusable package. However, to understand Polymer, we'll do a brief crash-course on a specific kind of component: _web_ components. 

**Web components** are [reusable](http://webcomponents.org) [widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) that can be assembled like building blocks in web documents and apps. They are a set of browser features and are being added to the [W3C HTML and DOM specification](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components). A web component is composed of four standards: 

* [Custom Elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/)
* [HTML Templates](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element)
* [Shadow DOM](https://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/)
* [HTML Imports](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports/)

In a nutshell, web components allow us to architect and [import](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/) [custom elements](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/customelements/) that automatically associate JS behavior with [templates](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/template/) and can utilize [shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/shadowdom) to provide CSS scoping and DOM encapsulation. 

Web components can be used natively _without_ any additional libraries or toolsets. However, because not all features are supported by all browsers, we need to leverage **Polymer** or [polyfills like webcomponents.js](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) to bridge the gap between the current state of browser support and the future.

## Enter Polymer

**[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)** is a library created by Google that enables us to build cross-browser compatible apps and elements with web components. It provides syntactic sugar to native web components as well as [polyfills for browsers](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/browsers) that don't support web components yet. Shadow DOM is difficult and costly to polyfill, so Polymer uses [shady DOM](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/shadydom) to [implement the features of shadow DOM](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/shadydom#shadow-dom-is-awesome-why-is-there-a-shady-dom) in browsers that lack support.

The **[Polymer Element Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/)** provides many [pre-built custom elements that can be easily implemented](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/using-elements) in any Polymer project. They provide useful utilities like [Ajax](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax), [media queries](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-media-query), and [single page application routing](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-route) as well as the [visual "Paper" elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements) of [Google's Material Design](https://material.google.com/).

Polymer has comprehensive documentation at the [Polymer Project Devguide](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview) and can be used with or without the custom elements in the Element Catalog. We'll build our simple single page application (SPA) with Polymer and Polymer elements.

## Setup and Installation

We're going to use the new [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) to scaffold our Polymer web app with the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/). By beginning with the starter kit, we'll gain the advantages of routing, app layout, Material Design, and many core utilities right away. 

Let's get started!

### Dependencies

First, make sure that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. 

Next, if you don't have [Bower](https://bower.io/) yet, install it globally with the following command: 

```
npm install -g bower
```

Now install the Polymer CLI: 

```
npm install -g polymer-CLI
```

### Initializing the App

Create a new directory and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt. Use the following command to initialize the Polymer starter kit in your new folder:

```
polymer init starter-kit
```

This command installs the starter kit app, tests, and necessary Bower components. Once the command completes, we can view the app in the browser by running:

```
polymer serve
```

The site runs at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Adding the optional flag `--open` will automatically launch that address in your default browser.

If you want to see the shadow DOM nodes in action in the inspector during development, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended. The app works in all modern browsers thanks to Polymer's inclusion of shady DOM and polyfills, but Chrome currently has the best native support for web components. 

You should see a screen like this:
