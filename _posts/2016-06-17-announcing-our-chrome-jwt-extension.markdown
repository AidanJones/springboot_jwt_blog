## A New Chrome Extension
We noticed many users rely on [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) to debug their JWTs. And with good reason! The colored visual editor is intuitive and has support for both HMAC and RSA signed JWTs. So we thought: what if we made this available offline for all users with a few extra features? So our [new Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jwt-debugger/ppmmlchacdbknfphdeafcbmklcghghmd) was born.

## Features
- Visual JWT editor with coloring:

- Support for HS256 (HMAC + SHA256) signed JWTs:
![JWT Debugger HS256 support](https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/chrome-extension/hs256-2.png)

- Support for RS256 (RSA) signed JWTs:

- Load and save JWTs in cookies and web storage from the current tab:

- Get a shareable URL for your JWTs:
