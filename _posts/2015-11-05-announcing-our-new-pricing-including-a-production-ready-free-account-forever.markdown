At Auth0 we‚Äôre shipping a new pricing today üëèüí∏. As some of you may know, choosing the right pricing is one of the hardest things a company has to do. Even more for a platform like Auth0 considering the many different use cases it can help with. 5 months ago, we‚Äôve decided to put all the necessary time and resources to make this new pricing, the best! Considering Auth0 is a company made out of engineers, we wanted to take a more scientific approach to pricing. Based on researching data from our subscribers and feedback we got, we‚Äôve created this new version that we think is fair for everyone: from developers and small businesses to startups, big companies and enterprises. 

## These are the 5 major changes:

* **Free Plan including 7,000 monthly active users**: Using Auth0 with the basic setup (username/password, 2 social providers or passwordless authentication) should be a no-brainer decision for any developer. Main advantage of this plan vs using other oss projects like [passportjs](http://passportjs.org/) for node, or [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for ruby, is that besides a really easy to use API, you also don‚Äôt have to worry about storing the users, keeping the passwords safe nor staying up to date with any API changes that happen to each of the identity providers. Oh, and if you need any other extra security features like multifactor authentication, you can just add them with a flip of a switch, no extra code. 7,000 active users represents 50,000 total users assuming 15% of them are active (common active ratio from our subscribers)
* **Free Unlimited Open Source Plan**: We ‚ô•Ô∏èÔ∏è OSS and we want every project to use the full Auth0 platform without worrying about $$ ever.

* **Up to 70% price reduction for developers and small businesses**: Individual devs and small business that generate little or no revenue will benefit from more affordable plans.
* **Better feature segmentation**: We analysed our user base and segmented our features in different plans for each of the different use cases and priced them accordingly so everybody pays what is fair.
* **Internal vs External users**: A lot of companies are using Auth0 to either protect applications used by employees (internal usage) or by non-employees (external usage). We now price plans for internal usage per employee.

## Conclusion

We‚Äôve worked hard from defining all the different tiers and plans to choosing what words we use in each of the tooltips so that everything is 100% clear.
