Authentication has increasingly become an important part of all web applications and sites. Long gone are the days of applications that simply performed an action whithout getting any details as to the identity of user that performed those actions. In this post we will explore one of the most powerful (and easiest) ways of improving the security of your authentication process: two-factor authentication.

## Two-Factor Authentication (or 2FA)
Two-factor authentication has become quite popular. As you may have guessed, it works by providing an additional layer of authentication that is independent from the main layer. Most applications make use of the usual username + password combination, though any two independent authentication methods may be combined. In the following paragraphs we will explore one authentication method that has become popular for use as the second step in 2FA: the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (or TOTP).

## Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (or TOTP)
TOTP is defined in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238). It is free and simple. There are many open-source implementations for both the client-side and server-side components. In particular, Google has developed an application that is freely available for Android, iOS and the web: Google Authenticator. This application allows us to easily integrate TOTP in our developments. We will explore how to do so in the following sections, but first I'll give you a quick summary of TOTP and how it usually works.

![Typical 2FA flowchart](http://assets.auth0.com/blog/twofa/Flowchart.png "Typical 2FA flowchart")

As you may have gathered from the chart above, the main requirement for TOTP to work is a shared secret. This shared secret needs to be generated and then stored by both the client and the server side components of the system. This usually means that an "enrolment" step is necessary before making TOTP available in an application.

Another important thing to keep in mind: as the name of the algorithm implies, generated codes are time-dependent. Clocks need to be synchronized between the client and server and are invalidated after a certain amount of time. 

### Cool (and not so cool) features
The cool thing about TOTP is that once the enrolment step is complete (i.e. a shared key has been setup between the client and the server), any client-side device can generate the required code for your application. This device need not be online, nor be the same device where your application is running. The only requirement is that clocks need to be (somewhat) synchronized and that the shared-key must be known to both sides. I consider this to be quite cool. 

Another cool feature is that it is quite easy to integrate to most applications (as you will see in the example below).

Now for that bad side: we are still sharing a secret. The whole point of a password is that it must be secret. So how is that different from the shared secret in TOTP? This is true and could be considered a weakness for your use case. If so, consider other authentication methods. The upside when compared to a password is that the device storing it need not be the same as the one that runs or serves the application that needs to perform the authentication (as said before). Consider this difference carefully when picking TOTP for your developments.

Another point against TOTP could be the inconvenient enrolment step. It may be confusing for non-technical users. This obviously depends on the application or device that will be providing the codes. Study this carefully with your UX team before deciding on TOTP. You should also consider what happens in case the user loses access to his or her code generating application or device.

## Adding TOTP to your Node.js application
As you may have seen in the previous chart, adding 2FA with TOTP to an application requires two independent steps:

1. A setup step: which basically requires creating a new shared secret between the client and the server side components of the authentication system.
2. An additional authentication step: where the actual authentication is carried out.

In this case, the first step will be handled manually by us. We will add code to generate a new random key and store it along with other user authentication information. The second step, the actual authentication, will be handled by passport-totp, a passport.js strategy that validates the user entered TOTP code and requires access to the user specific key. We will also require the user to install Google Authenticator (or other similar app) to generate codes with his or her cellphone. The user may also choose to use the Google Authenticator Chrome app.

You can find all the code from the following snippets here: [app.js](https://github.com/sebadoom/auth0/blob/master/twofa/backend/app.js)

### Step one: enrolment
After the usual passport.js and express.js setup, we add the necessary TotpStrategy:

```javascript
passport.use(new TotpStrategy(
    function(user, done) {
        var key = user.key;
        if(!key) {
            return done(new Error('No key'));
        } else {
            return done(null, base32.decode(key), 30); //30 = valid key period
        }
    })
);
```

As usual, passport will call this callback with the actual 'user' object as deserialized from the request. In this case, we are using a simple JSON-based filesystem storage. In production, you should never store passwords and secrets as plain text. The 'user' object contains a 'key' string that may be null. In case the key is null, we will consider TOTP disabled and allow logins with just a username and password. In case the key is present, we will require an additional input from the user before proceeding with the login. The key must be provided to passport as a bytearray, but for convenience (and because Google Authenticator requires so) we store it as a BASE32 encoded string. The 'period' is the amount of time a single TOTP code es valid from the moment it is requested to the moment it is entered.

The enrolment step requires the user to be already logged-in (as this is necessary to enable of disable TOTP in the server for each specific account). If the user chooses to enable TOTP, we present the shared-secret as a QR code ready to scan and save in Google Authenticator:

```javascript
app.get('/totp-setup', 
    isLoggedIn,
    ensureTotp,
    function(req, res) {
        var url = null;
        if(req.user.key) {
            var qrData = sprintf('otpauth://totp/%s?secret=%s', 
                                 req.user.username, req.user.key);
            url = "https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=166x166&chld=L|0&cht=qr&chl=" + 
                   qrData;
        }
    
        res.render('totp-setup', {
            strings: strings,
            user: req.user,
            qrUrl: url 
        });
    }
);

app.post('/totp-setup',
    isLoggedIn,
    ensureTotp,
    function(req, res) {
        if(req.body.totp) {
            req.session.method = 'totp';
            
            var secret = base32.encode(crypto.randomBytes(16));
            //Discard equal signs (part of base32, 
            //not required by Google Authenticator)
            //Base32 encoding is required by Google Authenticator. 
            //Other applications
            //may place other restrictions on the shared key format.
            secret = secret.toString().replace(/=/g, '');
            req.user.key = secret;
        } else {
            req.session.method = 'plain';
            
            req.user.key = null;
        }
        
        res.redirect('/totp-setup');
    }
);
```

If the user chooses to enable TOTP, we generate a new secret-key randomly. Then we encode it in BASE32 formate for easy storage and to show it to the user).

### Step two: a new authentication step
Once 2FA is enabled, logins will now be performed in two different steps: a username and password as usual, and then, a 6-digit code input which the user will need to get from Google Authenticator every time he or she wants to login. So we will add the necessary code to perform the login and then to allow the user to enter the code after the first step is done.

#### Logins are now performed in two steps if the user has 2FA enabled

```javascript
app.post('/login', 
    passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
    function(req, res) {
        if(req.user.key) {
            req.session.method = 'totp';
            res.redirect('/totp-input');
        } else {
            req.session.method = 'plain';
            res.redirect('/totp-setup');
        }
    }
);
```

After the usual username + password authentication, we check whether a TOTP code is required. If so, we redirect the user to the "totp-input" page. Otherwise we send him or her to the usual place after login (in this case, for simplicity, we just keep a totp-setup page as the landing page after a successful login). Keep in mind that all places the require authentication need to check for both the standard login and the TOTP login (which is optional) for this to be secure. For instance:

```javascript
app.get('/totp-setup', 
    isLoggedIn,
    ensureTotp,
    function(req, res) {
        var url = null;
        if(req.user.key) {
            var qrData = sprintf('otpauth://totp/%s?secret=%s', 
                                 req.user.username, req.user.key);
            url = "https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=166x166&chld=L|0&cht=qr&chl=" + 
                   qrData;
        }
    
        res.render('totp-setup', {
            strings: strings,
            user: req.user,
            qrUrl: url 
        });
    }
);
```

And here are the implementations of the middlewares that perform the check:

```javascript
function isLoggedIn(req, res, next) {
    if(req.isAuthenticated()) {
        next();
    } else {
        res.redirect('/login');
    }
}

function ensureTotp(req, res, next) {
    if((req.user.key && req.session.method == 'totp') ||
       (!req.user.key && req.session.method == 'plain')) {
        next();
    } else {
        res.redirect('/login');
    }
}
```

As you can see, for the TOTP check, we make use of a helper variable ('method') inside the session. Session information is stored server side, so this is safe to do. The client just keeps a session id. This extra session variable is set in the login handler (POST), which we have shown above.

## Conclusion
Adding two factor authentication to your node apps using TOTP and passport.js is fairly easy. Doing so improves the security of your authentication process. Google Authenticator provides a simple and stable client side implementation of the code generating application that any user can install in his or her phone. Just keep in mind what will happen in case a user loses access to his or her code generating device or secret key. Other than that, hack along!
