### Introduction

Today we are announcing [new pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing), along with a new free and full-featured [developer plan](https://auth0.com/signup).

### New Pricing

Auth0 subscriptions can now be tailored by:

* identity provider types (Social, Social+ and Enterprise) 
* number of __active__ users 
* and optional features 

This model greatly enhances the flexibility of our plans, allowing you to purchase custom packages that best fit your needs.

### Always Free for Developers 

We are also changing our developer subscription: 

* it now includes **all the features** of the Auth0 platform
* it is **not** time bound
* it is **free** for non-production use (up to 100 active users)  

Developers can now use the entirety of the Auth0 platform to test all the required use cases and move to a paid plan only when it is the right time to do so.

### How the new pricing works 

#### (1) Choose identity provider type

The first step is to choose the identity provider type you need:

* **Social** : This subscription enables Google, Facebook and Twitter authentication by default, and offers the option to authenticate to [many more popular social IdPs](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders).

* **Social +** : This subscription includes [all popular social IdPs](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders) as well as username and password database management. 

* **Enterprise** : In addition to all the Social+ capabilities, this subscription includes support for [all popular enterprise IdPs](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders) (e.g. AD, LDAP, ADFS, Google Apps, SAML-P, etc).  The Enterprise subscription optionally supports [3rd party application single sign-on](https://docs.auth0.com/sso) (e.g. SSO for Salesforce, O365, Zendesk and many others). 


#### (2) Choose how many active users

The second step is to choose how many __active__ users you want to include in your plan. Note that Auth0 counts only __active__ users, not registered users, meaning that you pay only for the actual authentications to your app, API or IoT device and not for dorment people in your database or enterprise. An active user is ___a user that has authenticated at least once in the past 30 days.___ 

The Auth0 service scales to millions of users per subscriber.  You can choose up to 100,000 Social or Social+ active users and up to 5,000 enterprise __active__ users through our self service platform.  For higher volumes please [contact us](mailto: sales@auth0.com).

#### (3) Choose optional features

##### Trust, Reliability and Premium Support
Auth0 is regularly audited for [SOC 2 compliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Organization_Controls) to demonstrate the trust we've earned from our worldwide base of sophisticated and exacting subscribers.  We now also offer [Premium Support](https://auth0.com) and a [Guaranteed SLA](https://auth0.com) as optional features.

##### Public Cloud, Private Cloud or On-Prem
The vast majority of Auth0 subscribers' needs are fulfilled by our public cloud service.  However, if you have compliance or other constraints that require a private cloud or on-prem deployment, please [contact us](mailto:sales@auth0.com).

### Conclusion

We are very excited about both our new [new pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing) and our new free and full-featured [developer plan](https://auth0.com/signup). Give them a go and do not hesitate to [share your feedback](mailto:sales@auth0.com).
