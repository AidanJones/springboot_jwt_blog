Today I am very proud to announce that we’ve raised $2.4 Million in seed funding led by **[Bessemer Venture Partners](http://bvp.com)**, with participation from [K9 Ventures](http://www.k9ventures.com/), [Portland Seed Fund](http://www.portlandseedfund.com/), [NXTP Labs](http://www.nxtplabs.com/) and individual investors.
 
I am also very proud to share that [Auth0](https://auth0.com) has crossed the 8,000 subscriber mark and is now used in 124 countries.

We were founded by developers for developers, with the goal of eliminating the pain of integrating authentication and authorization into apps and APIs.  So we’re very happy that so many developers from enterprises both large and small are finding our service useful.  We now deliver identity-as-a-service to not only the newest startups but also to the very largest enterprises, like [Schneider Electric](http://www.schneider-electric.com/), the global specialist in energy management, [Allegion](http://www.allegion.com/), the leading provider of security solutions for homes and businesses around the world, and [Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection](https://www.bhtp.com/), the Berkshire Hathaway travel insurance arm.  We’ve been told by our subscribers that we’re the most innovative identity company in the market today, so we are further pleased to announce that the world’s leader in innovation management and collaborative project management platform software, [Mindjet](http://mindjet.com), is now using Auth0 as their core identity component for their software.
 
We are using our seed funds to further expand our development [team](mailto://jobs@auth0.com) and to expand our sales and marketing efforts.  

We founded Auth0 to eliminate the pain of authentication and authorization for developers. We’re happy that we’ve been found useful by so many developers already, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.
